# Notes APP
This is a java-based Android notes application that allows users to take remarks. This app was created using the MVVM framework. <br>
Model — View — ViewModel (MVVM) is a well-known computer architectural style that addresses all of the shortcomings of the MVP and MVC design patterns. MVVM advocates isolating the data presentation logic (Views or UI) from the application's main business logic.<br>
